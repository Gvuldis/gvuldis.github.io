function transfer(bankName) {
    // In a real application, you would handle the transfer process here
    // For this demo, we'll just show an alert
    alert('Transferring to: ' + bankName);

    // Here you would typically redirect the user or perform an AJAX request
    // For example:
    // window.location.href = 'https://www.' + bankName.toLowerCase() + '.lv/transfer';
